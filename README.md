Blind signal analysis with gnuradio and python

I just throw some gnuradio stuff in there so that I don't delete any of it by
accident. It may be helpful for other people, but theres almost certainly a
better way to do it.

I usually do basic signal filtering in gnuradio and then send the raw bitstream
to a python program via a tcp socket.
